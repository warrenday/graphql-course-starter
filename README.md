# Graph Hire

The demo application for the Overstacked Full Stack GraphQL course.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the seed script: `npm run seed`
3. Start the development server: `npm run start`

## App Details

The application is a mock job board where users can view jobs and apply to them. Admins can create, edit, and delete jobs.

The purpose of this application to demonstrate how to build a full stack application with GraphQL. Therefore all of the non-graphql code is done for you. You can then focus purely on the GraphQL aspects of the application.

## Seed Data

- Regular user: `user@example.com` / `password123`
- Admin user: `admin@example.com` / `password123`

## Notes

This application is not production ready. Some decisions were made to make the application easier to understand and more concise. For example, passwords are stored in plain text in the database.
